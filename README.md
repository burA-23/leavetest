In the modern work-life  balaance paradigm the pressure is constantly increasing and work demands alot of an employees's time, resources and attention. 
Some of the factors driving this phoenomena include technology, digitization, mental health decline, Populaton growth  in the cities, Limmited opportunites which lead to a fierce competition and many other not necessarily correlated points.
Prioritiziig our well-being as employees by taking breaks to  relieve burn-outs , spend time with loved ones is an issue that has been overlookded especially with the trends that praise working over taking periods of rest. 
Most Industries , Corporations and Governent agencies encourage their workers to take some time away from work through leave days which is time allocated for every employee to spend how they wish however they do not stress the point that It should be away from the office
I came up with this monolithic web application while I was on a 10 day leave -- took me a while to get the logic working and I am proud to say the logic works 99.99% with no errors encountered so far.
The UI, Database implementatation are still being worked on but feel free to contribute in your ingenuous ways!
